PS2_CLK - F4
PS2_DAT - B2
PIC24FJ128


PS/2 protocol
11-bit words (start bit, data byte (LSB first), odd parity, and stop bit)
Idle state is logic 1, 
0xAA (self-test passed) signal when keyboard hooked up.
PS/2 Scan codes
if key held down, scan code will be sent every 100ms
When key release, an F0 keyup code is sent (or E0)
keyboard can only send data when both data and clock lines are high('1')

clock line low
11-bit word sent
'0' start bit, 8 bit scan code (LSB first), then odd parity bit, and a '1' stop bit,
11 clock transitions when data is sent
data is valid on falling edge
